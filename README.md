# HYPERTENSION BOT PROJECT
This is a project three-year degree in [Applied Computer Science](https://informatica.uniurb.it/) realized in collaboration with the [University of Urbino "Carlo Bo"](https://www.uniurb.it/). Professor [Sara Montagna](https://www.uniurb.it/persone/sara-montagna) is following me in this pilot project.

## Description
This project is aimed at helping [Dr. Martino Pengo](https://www.auxologico.it/equipe/dott-martino-pengo) and the problem that has afflicted the world for several years, namely [arterial hypertension](https://www.marionegri.it/magazine/ipertensione-arteriosa?gclid=CjwKCAiA85efBhBbEiwAD7oLQOezC4HCCgRSeiOY6Uz37gq6RZE-66ushhO-qMO1IpgHw4-OOYTKNhoCA3cQAvD_BwE). The project was developed in [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/), there is [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) as SQL Database and [Telegram API](https://core.telegram.org/) lets are used.
The main aim of the project is to develop a [ChatBot](https://www.oracle.com/it/chatbots/what-is-a-chatbot/) that helps patients suffering from this disease in the daily entry of data relating to their blood pressure. In recent years, ChatBots have become more and more popular and have proved to be a trump card in the medical field.

## Installation
### Windows 8/10/11
#### Install the SDK
The .NET SDK allows you to develop apps with .NET. If you install the .NET SDK, you don't need to install the corresponding runtimes. To install the .NET SDK, run the following command:

```bash
winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.7
```
#### Install the runtime .NET Desktop Runtime
For Windows, there are three .NET runtimes you can install. You should install both the .NET Desktop Runtime and the ASP.NET Core Runtime to ensure that you're compatible with all types of .NET apps.

This runtime includes the base .NET runtime, and supports Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Windows Forms apps that are built with .NET. This isn't the same as .NET Framework, which comes with Windows.

```bash
winget install Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.7
```
